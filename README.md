👋 Hey there, I’m Ryan — Lua Game Developer, Educator & Indie Creator
I’m a self-taught game developer who turned a childhood passion for games into a full-time creative career. For the past 4+ years, I’ve been building worlds, scripting mechanics, and bringing ideas to life through code.

From humble beginnings tweaking scripts in my room, I’ve grown into a versatile 2D/3D game developer, releasing two full games on Steam and building a loyal community of learners and gamers.

🎮 What I Do
🛠 Game Development
I craft games from scratch using Lua, blending creativity with clean code to create both 2D pixel art adventures and 3D immersive experiences. My games are powered by engines like Love2D, Defold, and Roblox Studio.

🚀 Steam Releases
My games aren’t just passion projects — they’ve made it to Steam, where thousands of players around the world have enjoyed the results of my work.

📹 YouTube Education
I run a YouTube channel dedicated to teaching the art of game development. From writing your first line of Lua to publishing your own game, I walk my audience through every step with practical, beginner-friendly lessons.

I regularly mentor beginner game devs, helping them bring their ideas to life, debug their code, and stay motivated through the challenges of development.
